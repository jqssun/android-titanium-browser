# Chromium Browser for Android

Custom Chromium browser development for Android with
performance optimizations and privacy enhancements.

## Project Goal

The current plan is to fork
[Brave Browser](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser)
and apply custom patches for enhanced performance and
features on Android devices.

---

## Base Project

### Brave Browser
**Repository:** [brave/brave-browser](https://github.com/brave/brave-browser)

**Why Brave?**
- Built on Chromium with privacy-first approach
- Active development and maintenance
- Built-in ad/tracker blocking
- Strong Android support
- Open source with permissive license

---

## Planned Patches

### Performance Optimizations

#### 1. Skia Scale Patch
**Source:** [thorium/skia_scale.patch](https://github.com/Alex313031/thorium/blob/main/other/skia_scale.patch)

**Purpose:** Optimizes Skia graphics rendering for better
performance and reduced memory usage on mobile devices.

**Benefits:**
- Improved scrolling performance
- Better canvas rendering
- Reduced GPU memory consumption
- Smoother animations

## Build Process

### Building for Android

```bash
# Set up Android build environment
npm run build -- --target_os=android --target_arch=arm64

# Configure build
gn args out/android_arm64

# Build flags (add to args.gn)
target_os = "android"
target_cpu = "arm64"
is_official_build = true
is_debug = false

# Build
ninja -C out/android_arm64 chrome_public_apk

# Output APK location
# out/android_arm64/apks/BraveMonoPublic.apk
```

### Build Variants

| Variant | Target | Description |
|---------|--------|-------------|
| `arm` | 32-bit ARM | Older devices |
| `arm64` | 64-bit ARM | Modern devices (recommended) |
| `x86` | 32-bit Intel | Emulators |
| `x86_64` | 64-bit Intel | Emulators, Chrome OS |

---

## Testing

### Installation

```bash
# Install APK via ADB
adb install -r out/android_arm64/apks/BraveMonoPublic.apk

# Or install on emulator
adb -e install -r out/android_arm64/apks/BraveMonoPublic.apk
```

### Performance Testing

```bash
# Monitor performance
adb shell dumpsys meminfo com.brave.browser
adb shell dumpsys gfxinfo com.brave.browser

# Capture logs
adb logcat | grep -i chromium
```

---

## Patch Management

### Creating Patches

```bash
# Make changes in src/
cd src
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"

# Create patch file
git format-patch HEAD~1 --stdout > ../patches/custom/my_patch.patch
```

### Applying Multiple Patches

```bash
# Apply all patches in directory
for patch in patches/custom/*.patch; do
    git apply "$patch"
done
```
